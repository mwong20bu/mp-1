                <h3>Rescuing Leftover Cuisine Club</h3>
                <p><strong>Roles: Volunteer and Lead Rescuer</strong><br>
                    I volunteered with the Rescuing Leftover Cuisine from 2015 to 2020. RLC is a food waste prevention volunteer organization that collects leftover food from restaurants and 
                    other culinary businesses, and transports the food to shelters and pantries. As a volunteer, I participated in food transport meetings, and as a lead rescuer I 
                    helped schedule volunteer trips and served as a resource for new volunteers.
